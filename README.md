## Introduction

This repository is an archive of the original FastBlurs project by Intel Corporation.
The original project was hosted on the Intel Developer Zone, which has since been shut down.

The original project files have been rehosted here for archival purposes and to make them available to the public, because you can no longer find the original project files on the Intel Developer Zone.

The original project page can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/an-investigation-of-fast-real-time-gpu-based-image-blur-algorithms.html) 
and the original project files can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/fastblurs.zip). (The download link is still working, but you can't find it on the original project page anymore. Last checked on 20th of May 2024)
